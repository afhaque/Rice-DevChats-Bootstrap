# Rice-DevChats-Bootstrap
This repository provides a walkthrough  build of the [Rice DevChats website][DevChats Site] using Twitter Bootstrap. The commits demonstrate the steps taken in going from a scratch build to a completed design.  We'll be looking through each of these steps in more depth at our first [Rice DevChat Event][Facebook].

In order to come best prepared for the workshop, you'll need to complete a few steps in advance. While seasoned programmers can stray from these steps a bit if they'd like, I'm going to request all beginners to follow them as stated. It will help the workshop go more smoothly. I know it seems like a lot of steps, but it really will help in the long-run!

If you get lost trying to complete these steps, post on the Facebook event or shoot me an email (afhaque@rice.edu).

## Steps
1. Download and install Sublime Text (http://www.sublimetext.com/).

2. Once you've installed Sublime, you will need to install a few plugins. First up, Sublime Text Package Control (https://packagecontrol.io/). Follow the directions to Install. 

3. Once that is installed, open Sublime Text. Then press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette. From here, type: "Install Package" (an option should appear). Hit Enter. It will then prompt you to enter the name of the Package you would like to install. Type: "Emmet". This is the most important plugin we'll be using. 
 
4. Repeat the above step, but this time when prompted, you will install the package named: "SideBarEnhancements".

5. Repeat the above again for "HTML5", "Alignment", and SublimeCodeIntel". 

6. Now that you have Sublime set-up, download and install Atlassian's Source Tree (http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - Source Tree is a very easy to use Git Client that will be helpful in pulling commits as we go through the workshop.

7. Once Sourcetree is installed, head to this [repository][repo] and grab the "HTTPS clone URL" listed. 

8. Now, open Sourcetree and push the button titled: "Clone / New". Past the URL you just grabbed in the "Source Path / URL" entry. You can choose whichever Destination Path you like. Just make it one that is accessible -- this will be our working directory for the class.  At this point, you've "copied" all of the code (and steps) I used in creating the Rice DevChats website. This will help you trace back my steps (or catch-up) if you get lost during the workshop.

And at this point, you are all ready for the workshop! Feel free to explore the repo yourself in advance if you like (or don't!). We'll have a ton to cover, but hopefully, everyone will walk away with something!

Looking forward to our event,
